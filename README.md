## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze a previously unexamined dataset on Utah state health statistics to help the Utah DHHS understand what factors correlate with suicidal ideation, and to identify general trends and patterns. Our goal was to provide insights on populations at risk and inform government officials for potential policy or public health interventions. 

*This analysis was performed on secure institutional laptops with authorized access to the dataset. The data is not available for personal download or use.*

## Functionality / Features 
- Data Exploration: Cleaned and explored the dataset using **R**
- Risk Identification: Pinpointed groups and demographics most vulnerable to various health risks
- Visualizations: Created charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards in **Tableau** to clearly communicate findings

## Data
Utah's BRFSS Survey Data (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System): a nationwide health-related telephone survey that collects state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services

## Technical Approach
Developed research questions based on the information available in the dataset, then designed research arcs to systematically explore them. Visualizations were produced to highlight patterns and trends. Finally, we brainstormed conclusions and potential policy ideas based on the results.

## Results
The analysis was successful in uncovering trends across several demographic factors, such as employment status, marital status, sleep habits, religion, gender and age. These trends helped identify populations that may be at higher risk for health conditions, or suicidal ideation. 

*Screenshots of charts or interactive dashboards are unavailable.*

## Limitations / Future Work
- The dataset is restricted to authorized institutional access, limiting reproducibility for external users. This README focuses on methodology, trends, and insights as numerical results are unavailable. 
- Future work may include exploring additional datasets from other states, or track the changes in this survey data over time in Utah. Predictive models could be implemented to better identify high-risk populations.
